Smart Matching in Connect Care

The Smart Matching module in Connect Care is designed to process user inputs and match them against predefined criteria using Flask and Python. It serves as a backend functionality to identify relevant matches and respond accordingly, enhancing communication and interaction within the Connect Care platform.

How It Works

Input Handling: The module receives structured input data in JSON format.

Data Processing: Input data is processed using Flask routes, where matching logic is applied.

Matching Logic: The algorithm checks inputs against predefined patterns or keywords to identify relevant matches.

Response Generation: Upon finding a match, the module returns appropriate responses, including notifications, recommendations, or confirmations.

Key Components

app.py: Contains the main Flask application and routes for processing inputs.

match.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used for testing and refining the matching logic.

sample_input_ready.json: A sample JSON file with test data to simulate input processing.

Usage

Run the Flask server by executing python flask-backend/app.py.

Submit input data via the specified endpoint.

Receive matching responses based on the predefined criteria.

Next Steps

Enhance the matching algorithm to include more advanced criteria.

Integrate user feedback for continuous improvement.
